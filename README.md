# AI-Powered Code Review & Optimization Tool

## üöÄ Overview
The AI-Powered Code Review & Optimization Tool is a smart assistant that helps developers improve their code quality by analyzing, reviewing, and optimizing their code using AI. It detects performance bottlenecks, security risks, bad practices, and suggests best practices while also providing automatic refactoring options.

## üéØ Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Submission & Input Handling
- Upload code snippets (supports multiple languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Option to enter code manually or upload a file
- GitHub repository integration (fetch & analyze code directly)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Code Analysis & Review
- AI detects common issues (performance bottlenecks, security risks, bad practices)
- Suggests improvements with explanations
- Checks against best practices & style guides (e.g., PEP8, ESLint)
- Custom rule configuration for teams (optional)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Refactoring & Optimization
- AI suggests optimized versions of the code
- Auto-refactor option (apply AI suggestions automatically)
- Highlighted code differences (before vs after)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Best Practices Suggestions
- AI generates missing function/class documentation
- Recommends comments & explanations for complex logic
- Identifies redundant/unused code

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Collaborative Features (Future Enhancements)
- Share AI-reviewed code with team members
- Discussion threads for suggested changes
- Approve/reject AI-generated fixes

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ API & Integration Support
- REST API for external tools (VS Code extension, GitHub Actions, CI/CD integration)
- Webhook support for automated reviews

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard & User Management
- User authentication (Sign up, Login, OAuth for GitHub)
- Dashboard for code review history & analytics
- Settings for AI model preferences (e.g., GPT-4 vs. custom ML model)

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Nest.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, BullMQ (for task queues)
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, LangChain, Custom ML Models (Future Enhancements)
- **Storage**: Cloudinary (if needed for file uploads)
- **Authentication**: OAuth (GitHub, Google), JWT

## üöÄ Setup & Installation
(Instructions will be added once backend setup is complete)

## üìå Roadmap
1. **Backend Setup** (Nest.js, PostgreSQL, Auth, API Design)
2. **AI Code Analysis & Review Implementation**
3. **Frontend Dashboard & Code Submission UI**
4. **Code Optimization & Refactoring System**
5. **Collaboration & Integration Features**
